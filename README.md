- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Abdelmonem a Computer Science graduate.
 
-  Iâ€™m interested in the development of software whether they're desktop, web or mobile software. I'm also interested in Reverse-engineering where I diassemble non          open-source software to acquire the knowledge of how it actually works. After that, 
   modify it to alter its behavior and the manner in which it executes.
   
-  Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJs.
